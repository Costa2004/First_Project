# Game_Manager
This repository is my first Console Application made in C#.

Game Manager is an application that allows the user to manage a set/list of Games. Similar examples are the library screens in Steam or Xbox/PlayStation's user interface that contains all the purchased games.

The program works alongside a database that has all the information regarding the games and their respective prices and genre. The data structure itself is located inside a file in the .XML format called “games.xml”.
