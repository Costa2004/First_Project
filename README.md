# Game_Manager
This repository is my first Console Application made in C#.

Game Manager is an application that allows the user to manage a set/list of Games. Similar examples are the library screens in Steam or Xbox/PlayStation's user interface that contains all the purchased games.

The program works alongside a database that has all the information regarding the games and their respective prices and genre. The data structure itself is located inside a file in the .XML format called “games.xml”.

To test the application:

1 - Clone this Repository to your compiler using: git clone https://github.com/Costa2004/Game_Manager.git

2 - Try to run the .exe file inside the directory: /Semestral Project - Game Manager Application/bin/degub/net8.0
